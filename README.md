# Pure JS project boilerplate

> Aimed to help beginners or whoever want to start developing in pure js projects.

This boilerplate is very simple and not aimed to use any frameworks or libraries like `jQuery` or not even `es5` or `esnext` syntax.

It can be helpful for beginners to learn JavaScript because it is available with demo app and *linting* configured plus *tdd* enabled environment.

It can also be useful for those who quickly want to start doing something and don't want to waste time in configuring basic things. For instance, to start giving some *test* ;)

## Features
  - No frameworks included
  - Configured with `eslint` recommended linting rules
  - Configured with unit testing using `karma`, `mocha`, `chai` and `sinon`. Can run tests in `headless chrome` or `real chrome browser`.
  - Demo app included with tests

## Getting started
Clone this repo
  - To start local server: `npm start`
  - To test: `npm test`
